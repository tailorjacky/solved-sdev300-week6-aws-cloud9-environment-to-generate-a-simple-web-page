This exercise  uses the AWS Cloud9 environment to generate a simple Web page using

Python flask. The Web page should include all basic components of the HTML structure including:

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

&lt;html&gt;

&lt;head&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

…your page content…

&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;

In addition to the basic HTML structure components listed above, your web page should demonstrate and include the following HTML tags and functionality:

<ul>

 <li>At least 3 different Headings (e.g. &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;)</li>

 <li>Paragraph (&lt;p&gt;)</li>

 <li>Comments &lt;!– –&gt;)</li>

 <li>Ordered list</li>

</ul>

<ul>

 <li>Unordered list</li>

 <li>At least 3 Links to other External Web Sites</li>

 <li>Display the Date and Time on the Web page (Hint: Just use the Python date/time functions to display in HTML)</li>

</ul>

The content and topic of the Web site is up to you. It should be unique and something you want to create.

Hints:

<ol>

 <li>Be sure to end tags that are started (e.g. &lt;h1&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;)</li>

 <li>Start early. This will take you longer than you think.</li>

 <li>Be sure to send me questions, if you need assistance.</li>

</ol>

2. Document your results of the application running from the AWS Cloud9 classroom environment.  Provide screen captures and descriptions of you running the Python application within AWS Cloud9 verifying you successfully started and have navigated to your Web application using your Browser. Show screen captures of your Web application running on the Browser
